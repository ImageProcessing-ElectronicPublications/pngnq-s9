INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

This should work on most UNIX style systems:

tar -xvf pngnq-s9-2.0.2.tar.gz
cd pngnq-s9-2.0.2
./configure
make
sudo make install

If you are using gcc on a modern x86 system, you may get much better
performance if you configure with:

    ./configure CFLAGS="-O3 -msse -funroll-loops"

instead.  

Similar flags (to enable floating point SIMD operations and to enable loop
unrolling) will probably be worthwhile on other compilers/architectures,
assuming those optimizations aren't performed by default.

If configure doesn't work, the dependencies are simple enough to just
compile by hand:

gcc -c rwpng.c
gcc -c neuquant32.c
...
gcc -o pngnq-s9 pngnq.o neuquant32.o rwpng.o colorspace.o -lpng16 -lz 

There may be warnings about various legacy practices; parts of the code
are quite old and the orthodoxies of C and C compilers have changed a lot
over the years.
