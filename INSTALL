INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

This should work on most UNIX style systems:

tar -xzvf pngnq-s9-2.0.tar.gz
cd pngnq-s9-2.0
./configure
make
sudo make install

If you are using gcc on a modern x86 system, you may get much better
performance if you configure with:

    ./configure CFLAGS="-O3 -msse -funroll-loops"

instead.  

Similar flags (to enable floating point SIMD operations and to enable loop
unrolling) will probably be worthwhile on other compilers/architectures,
assuming those optimizations aren't performed by default.


NOTES:
There may be warnings about strings being too long. Unless you have a really
ancient compiler these can be safely ignored.  Also, you should get the
following warning from gcc: "ISO C forbids casts to union type".  This is
because we use an early, somewhat hacky version of GCC's vector data types.
The correct way to fix this is for us to eventually switch to using the
improved syntax in more recent versions of GCC.  If you really don't like
warnings add --std=c99 to the CFLAGS or get rid of --pedantic.

If you successfully build this on a system other than those listed below please
tell me. Also tell me if it does not work. 

* Ubuntu 12.04, gcc, x86-64 (Intel).
* Ubuntu 10.04, gcc, x86 (AMD).
