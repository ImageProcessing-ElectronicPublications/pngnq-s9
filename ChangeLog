September 2016:
	pngnq-s9-2.0.2: -P altered to maintain order of supplied palette colours
	in output image.  Fixed bug YUV colorimportance bug.  Fixed erroneous
	writing of directory separator for directory supplied by -d option.
	Removed freegetopt and some other vestigial files that were complicating
	compilation.

September 19, 2012:  
    pngnq-s9-2.0.1: Two small changes to allow compilation on Cygwin:
    src/Makefile.am changed so it no longer links to a specific version of
    libpng; #include "zlib.h" added to rwpng.c so it doesn't have to rely on
    other header files to do this.

August 2012: pngnq-s9-2.0 released as alpha.  Substantial modification of pngnq.

17th June 2011 Version 1.1 Released

Bugfixes:

Fixed -d option so that it gives the correct directory now.

Removed spurious error message when -Qf option was given.

Include unistd.h for getopt, will use the bundled freegetopt if getopt is no available.

Can now overwrite files in place.

Fix for images with mainly one color being quantized with a low number of colors so that
they now should have the correct transparent areas.
